# Random Song Generator
This is a website created in React using Node.js as the backend. It scrapes youtube urls from playlist and displays them in a tik-tok scroll style. It includes artist name and song title in each entry.
# How I made it
First I needed an API handmade for this site. I used a scraping method to grab ten urls at a time and push them through a get method called by the website. My biggest struggle was working with asynchronous programming for the first time. I had to  make sure all the urls were stored before the site could view them. I learned how to allow the app to wait for all the urls, including when the user selected "View more". Next was learning how to start the songs when the user was scrolling thorugh them. I used an intersection observer to play the songs when the song was directly on top of the viewport.
